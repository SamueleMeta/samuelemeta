I have recently completed my Master of Science in *Computer Science and Engineering* at Politecnico di Milano. Over the last few years, I have dedicated my time to learn everything I could about **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**, working on many projects. Now I am looking forward to finding the opportunity to apply my skills in a stimulating environment, working on cutting-edge technology.
